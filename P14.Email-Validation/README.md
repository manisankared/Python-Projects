📧 Python Email Validation Script

This project is a Python-based email validator that checks whether a given email address is valid or not using basic conditions. It helps beginners understand string handling, logical operators, and input validation in Python.

🔍 What This Script Does

When a user enters their email, the script checks for several rules to decide whether the email is valid. If the email breaks any rule, it shows a specific error message with a number to help identify the issue.

✅ Validation Rules

Length Check:
Email must be at least 6 characters long.

Starting Character:
The first character must be an English letter (a-z or A-Z).

@ Symbol Check:

Must contain exactly one @ symbol.

Dot (.) Check:

Email must end with a dot in the 3rd or 4th position from the end
(for example: .com, .net, .org, etc.).

Character Validity Check:

Only allows:

Letters (a-z, A-Z)

Numbers (0–9)

Underscores _

Dots .

At-symbol @

Disallows:

Whitespaces

Uppercase letters

Special characters like !, #, %, etc.

Error Reporting:
The script prints error messages like:

Wrong Email - 1 → Too short

Wrong Email - 2 → First character is not a letter

Wrong Email - 3 → Invalid @ usage

Wrong Email - 4 → Missing proper dot placement

Wrong Email - 5 → Other character issues

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Core string functions

Conditional logic

Loops and input handling

💡 Why I Made This

This project helped me practice:

String indexing and slicing

Input validation

Working with conditions (if, elif, else)

Logical operators and loops

It's a great starter project for anyone learning how to validate user input in Python.
