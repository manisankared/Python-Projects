⏳ Time-Traveling Journal – Python Project

This is a creative and interactive Python project that allows users to write personal journal entries, read old ones, and even write messages to their future self. It combines file handling, date management, and a bit of fun randomness.

📖 What This App Can Do

✅ Write your journal entry for today

📅 Read any entry by entering a specific date

🎲 Read a random entry from the past

🔮 Write a message to your future self for a specific date

❌ Exit anytime safely

All entries are saved in .txt files, automatically organized by date in a folder named entries.

🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to create something personal and practical while learning:

File handling in Python

Working with datetime and os modules

Taking user input

Random file selection logic

Menu-driven console apps

This app is like your personal time machine for thoughts.

💻 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x)

Download the script: 6_Time-Traveling Journal.py

Open terminal or command prompt

Run this command:

python "6_Time-Traveling Journal.py"


The script will create a folder named entries and store all journal files inside it.
